  ## Description
  Build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

  ## Installation 
  Make sure to install mysql2 and inquirer 8.2.4

  ## Usage 
  This is a CLI app, so open the terminal and type "node index.js" to run the program. It would also be helpful to have workbench installed to display any changes in "employee_db"

Here is a video link breaking down the code and showing the application running:
